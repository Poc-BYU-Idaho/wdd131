<!-- Site Ideas -->
<!-- Allow people to search for exercises based off of their names -->
<!-- Sort exercises alphabetically. -->
<!-- Create check boxes that allow people to filter for certain muscle groups. -->
<!-- Look at Copilot chats for help with this. -->
<!-- When someone clicks an exercise, take them to a child page that the exercise's information is dynamically loaded onto. -->
<!-- Maybe add a dark mode. -->
